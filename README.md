## ðŸ›  Development

The provided code includes two main Redux slices:

**Product Management** (productSlice.ts)

This slice is responsible for storing and fetching products from the backend. It uses createAsyncThunk to handle asynchronous API requests.

- **Initial State** (ProductState):
  - items: List of products.
  - isLoading: Indicates whether the products are being loaded.
- **Asynchronous Action** (loadProducts):
  - Makes a GET request to /products using axios.
  - Updates the state with the retrieved products.
- **Reducers** (extraReducers):
  - pending: Sets isLoading to true while fetching data.
  - fulfilled: Updates items with the fetched products and sets isLoading to false.

**Cart Management** (cartSlice.ts)

This slice manages the shopping cart, allowing users to add, remove, and update product quantities.

- **Initial State** (CartState):
  - items: List of products in the cart.
  - isEmpty: Indicates whether the cart is empty.
- **Reducers**:
  - addToCart: Adds an item to the cart and marks it as selected.
  - removeFromCart: Removes an item from the cart and sets isEmpty = true if the cart is empty.
  - incrementQuantity: Increases the quantity of an item in the cart.
  - decrementQuantity: Decreases the quantity or removes the item if it reaches 1.
